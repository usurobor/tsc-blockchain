## What This Is

TSC Blockchain is not a blockchain that "uses" Triadic Self-Coherence (TSC).  
It IS TSC in operational form.

Just as Bitcoin IS Proof-of-Work and Ethereum IS Smart Contracts,  
TSC Blockchain IS Triadic Self-Coherence.

## Core Principle

> "To cohere, one must self-cohere first."

Every system must furnish three articulations:
- **α (Pattern):** What it claims to be
- **β (Relation):** What actually exists  
- **γ (Process):** How it actually evolves

Coherence is measured as: **C_Σ = (α_c · β_c · γ_c)^(1/3)**

## Current Status

**Iteration:** 0.1.0 (Bootstrap)  
**Coherence:** C_Σ = 0.0 (not yet measured)  
**Phase:** Initial specification and structure  

**Target:** C_Σ ≥ 0.90 for mainnet launch

We practice radical transparency. Every iteration includes:
- Honest coherence measurement
- Public results (no hiding failures)
- Specific improvements based on measurement
- Re-measurement to validate progress

## Token

**TSC** - The currency of coherence
- Minted when blocks improve system coherence (Δλ_Σ > 0)
- Required for methodology publishing
- Staked by validators

- **Theory:** GPT-5 Pro (OpenAI)

## Development Status

### Iteration 0.1.0 (Current)
- [x] Repository created
- [x] Directory structure established
- [x] Documentation stubs created
- [ ] First measurement baseline (pending)

### Iteration 0.2.0 (Next)
- [ ] First coherence measurement (C_Σ baseline)
- [ ] Documentation alignment (fix α)
- [ ] Re-measurement (validate ΔC_Σ > 0)

See [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for full plan.

## Philosophy

This blockchain doesn't implement TSC as a feature.  
The three-articulation structure, self-measurement requirement,  
witness validation, and coherence-based consensus ARE the architecture.

Inseparable by design.
